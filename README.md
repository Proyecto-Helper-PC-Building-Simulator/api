# PC Building Simulator API

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is not an official API from the creators of the 'PC Building Simulator' game. 

This version uses a database stored for free in [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/) services. This means that it may take a while to get the required requests.

The database has been created by me based on the best practices I thought necessary. For more information about it, you can consult the following [repository](https://github.com/Proyecto-Helper-PC-Building-Simulator/database).

## Instructions
In order to use the API, download the JAR file from the `Releases` section and run the command `java -jar api-1.0.jar`.

Once it has been executed you can access the documentation generated with Swagger UI using the following link [`http://localhost:9090/pc/doc/swagger-ui/index.html`](http://localhost:9090/pc/doc/swagger-ui/index.html).

From here you will be able to consult the different requests present in the API.
